My child, never forget the things I have taught you.<br>
Store my commands in your heart.<br>
If you do this, you will live many years,<br>
and your life will be satisfying.<br>
Never let loyalty and kindness leave you!<br>
Tie them around your neck as a reminder.<br>
Write them deep within your heart.<br>
Then you will find favor with both God and people,<br>
and you will earn a good reputation.<br>
Trust in the Lord with all your heart;<br>
do not depend on your own understanding.<br>
Seek his will in all you do,<br>
and he will show you which path to take.

 <br><br>Proposed is a new network of small boardings schools for young teens and preteens. These homes will not only provide opportunity for girls to grow and learn in safety,  but will serve as touchpoints to expose many to both the needs of hurting kids but best practices in caring for them, following the example of Jesus.<br><br><br>
<br>Another quiet pandemic has been gripping Thailand. Between the continued downward spiral of family breakdown and the negative effects of technology/social media, children are increasingly traumatized, suffering from high anxiety, depression and dysfunctional behaviors. We see many dropping out of school (or being expelled, especially during grades 7 and 8. Many report frequent bullying.  
<br>Not only are school personnel barely trained in handling these kinds of issues, and there are no trained specialists, such as counselors or social workers.  
<br>A high percentage of kids, especially in working class environments, experience sexual exploitation at a young age. Usually the abuser is someone well known, e.g. a stepfather, uncle or neighbor.  
<br>Meanwhile, after a hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sex industry has fully rebounded. And while men's entertainment establishments are buzzing, the online platforms are growing. 
<br>The visible commercial sex industry is however only the tip of a large iceberg of exploitation, as girls are pimped to local men by older girls, young women, and in some cases, even their mothers. 
<br><br>
<br>The problem of sexual exploitation tends to bring girls to mind, but boys are also highly at risk, especially in the lower/working class where father absence and other instability is common.

<br>Lack of role models
<br>Both experience sexual abuse
<br>Socialized into addictions: sex, substances, gaming
<br>Social media heavily promotes narcissism. 


<br>This is not only about saving lives, but of saving society: making disciples who will teach others, that is, raising kids into leadership.
<br>There is a the very practical issue that women need husbands. While this may sound silly to a Westerner, it is indeed a reality for lower-class Thai women.

<br>Begin and grow a model boarding school that serves a growing number of children.
<br><br>
<br>Advocacy: educate others on the need and how they can help
<br><br>
<br>


<br>Children who, due to family situation and/or other factors, have a strong likelihood of entering a destructive lifestyle.

<br>


<br>Activity designed to rescue children who have already been exploited


<br>"Prevention" and "Intervention" are often viewed separately, but actually they best work together.<br>
<br>Intervention leads to prevention, through working with at-risk children of hurt people, or other family members. 
<br>Both share a common need for trauma identification and recovery. The reality is that most at-risk children have already suffered trauma, even at young ages.
<br><br>
<br>Communicate

<br>Explain the Gospel
<br>Recruit volunteers

<br><br>
<br>A staff-driven model is unsustainable.
<br>Students need to develop healthy relationships, including social capital for their futures.

<br>Age similarity facilitates teaching but also negative peer pressure 

<br>Have to be careful of same-sex attraction


<br>With age difference older kids help with. younger

<br>But easily misused.


<br>Must be able to maintain never-alone guidelines

<br>Zero cross-sex one-on-one
<br>Same-sex one-on-one also requires some care


<br><br>
<br>Homes can be managed with or without houseparents
<br>Each has advantages and disadvantages
<br>Non-houseparent requires more management

<br>Not only scheduling but keeping continuity and consistency between workers
<br>But it avoids the emotional intensity of 24-hour live-in.


<br>Couples as houseparents may be difficult with smaller homes due to "never alone" guidelines
<br><br><br><br>

 <br>I am a creative, dot-connecting visionary. Shy extrovert, meaning I'm energized by people but naturally self-conscious. The visionary part goes with substantial ADHD, although I'm not sure about the 'H', which makes for poor management. That is, I easily think of many things to do but then forget to check my to-do list. <br><br><br>
<br>B.A. Psychology Wheaton College, 1979
<br>M.Div. Trinity Ev. Divinity School, 1984
<br>Founding member and Associate Pastor overseeing worship, music and young adult ministry at Uptown Baptist Church in Chicago, a multi-ethnic inner-city Southern Baptist congregation, 1981-1993. Interim lead pastor for 2 years, 1993-95.
<br>Director of Cup of Cold Water Ministries (<a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="http://ccmw.org" target="_blank">http://ccmw.org</a>), a small independent mission-sending agency. Initiated its movement away from a narrow focus on community to development in Bolivia to an international sending scope, 1996-2000.  It was during this tenure that I first visited Thailand and received the call to come. 
<br>Independent video creator/producer, 2000-2004. Produced/created videos for Christian ministries; mostly in Illinois but also overseas. During this period also worked attempting to do house-style church geared at low-income residents in Aurora, Illinois. It was slow going and difficult, but it began some of the paradigm shifts that are covered in this proposal.
<br>Servantworks Thailand coordinator, 2004-present. 
<br><br>
<br>Grew up in a tiny country church in Illinois, within a very evangelical tradition of Lutheranism, descended from Norwegian revivalist Hans Neilson Hauge. 
<br>Trusted Jesus at a young age; became passionate for the Great Commission since childhood; grew up frustrated with the parish style of the Lutheran church that included many nominal members. 
<br>Got exposed to Southern Baptist tradition on annual visits to Dallas to visit my mother's family. Loved the emphasis on the Gospel and the weekly altar call.
<br>Active in direct evangelism to strangers since high school, both on the street and door-to-door. Door-to-door was also a significant part of our work in Chicago.
<br>Connected with Uptown Baptist Church in 1977 while a student at Wheaton. It was then a small storefront in a rough, neighborhood that was also an immigrant port of entry.
<br>Made a commitment as a young adult to live modestly in order to devote the most possible resources to reaching others; also to live in places of need. Judy also shared this commitment. We were the first wedding held at UBC.
<br>Worked in a facility caring for chronic mentally ill, also led Bible study along with Judy.  Attended TEDS by commute while living in Chicago; graduated and was ordained at UBC in 1984.

<br>
<br><br>
<br>Thai people are ready for Jesus
<br>We regularly see people drawn to Jesus when they have opportunity to understand
<br>We moved here in 2004 with the expectation that God had something big planned. Like prophetic foreshortening we expected quicker timing, but ultimately we see no reason to believe differently.
<br><br>
<br>Began 200 years ago. 
<br>Proselytization illegal until 1900, so nineteenth century missionaries focused on non-citizens: ethnic Chinese and hill tribe groups. But during the 1900's little happened to reach southern, central and northeast Thais.
<br>Campus Crusade reported 1 million professions of faith in response to the Jesus Movie campaign in the 1980's. A friend of mine was on one of the teams.
<br>In 2004, the Arthur S. DeMoss Foundation distributed over two million copies of their Power for Living booklet in response to TV ads. 
<br>Reaching Thailand in this Generation: The Thai Church’s National Plan By Dr. Randy Wollf, April 2010<br>
<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.worldevangelicals.org/pdf/2010_0512_Reaching_Thailand_in_this_Generation.pdf" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="http://www.worldevangelicals.org/pdf/2010_0512_Reaching_Thailand_in_this_Generation.pdf" target="_blank">2010_0512_Reaching_Thailand_in_this_Generation.pdf (worldevangelicals.org)</a>
<br>Churches are multiplying: estimated Christian population has at least doubled in our 15 years here, from 0.5% to 1%--a growth rate of about 5% per year.
<br><br><br>
<br>Rapid multiplication--Reach, Teach, Send. Women would share Jesus with their neighborhoods/villages
<br>Reach Isaan people--reach Thailand
<br>Working backbone--scattered throughout
<br>Cultural influence (the "cool" culture)
<br><br>
<br>Apparently genuine professions of faith not leading to life change 
<br>"Thais receive [Jesus] easily, but have a hard time growing." –Thai pastor

<br>คนไทยรับเชื่อง่ายโต้ยาก


<br>Parable of the sower--birds, thorns and rocks are everywhere
<br>People generally unable to go it alone 
<br>Churches had difficulty with brokenness 

<br>People disinvited
<br>Prison ministry same--had to start their own church


<br><br><br>
<br>There are some major distinctions.
<br><br>
<br>Similar systems
<br>Tropical village culture appropriate to its environment
<br>Simple
<br>Maternal
<br>Thai second language (changing)
<br>Animist
<br>Now--separated families
<br>"Find" money
<br>Spend, don't save
<br>Major languages still mostly unwritten
<br><br>
<br>Go with the flow
<br>Relationship outweighs truth
<br>Individualism is discouraged
<br>Respect, do not challenge
<br>Follow, do not lead
<br>Present-focused### Chinese Thai
<br>"Earn" money
<br>Save, then spend
<br><br>
<br>More aggressive than Isaan
<br>But still a lot of the same brokenness
<br><br>
<br>Religious groups
<br>Buddhist-Animist
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Conformity
<br>Learn traditional cultural forms
<br>Little to no emphasis on abstract reasoning, problem solving etc.
<br>No show-and-tell, book reading/reporting, essays, speeches
<br>Considerable time spent in group activities
<br>Group projects
<br>Intramural days
<br>Special days, re. Mother's Day, Father's Day, Teacher Day 
<br>Ram dance (girls)
<br>No failing
<br>Only fail for non-participation

<br>Make-up test
<br>Bribes (link to Tanya video)


<br>Result

<br>Limited core knowledge


<br>Limited abstract and analytical thinking ability 
<br><br><br>
<br>"All religions teach you how to be good."
<br>Active proselytization frowned upon
<br><br>
<br>Individualism is tolerated but not celebrated
<br>Example: transgender
<br>Example: organized labor 
<br><br>
<br>Historically polygynous (multiple wives)
<br>Wives as status
<br>Poor: rent
<br>Prostitution outlawed 1960
<br>Commercialized sex industry started in 1966

<br>Apologies for the suggestive photo
<br>Written by a non-Thai: Thai cultural critiques are rare
<br>Now - active teen culture
<br><br>
<br>Acts 2: spontaneous, expectant, houses and central hangout
<br>Ekklesia used loosely. Greek towns had a governing ekklesia, open to all adult males.
<br>Clear emphasis on life together far more than meetings
<br>No specification of church forms, only hints
<br>Suggest form should follow function
<br><br><br>
<br>Formal Organization

<br>Two key organizational styles<br>
- Congregational, democratic<br>
- Hierarchical, authoritarian


<br>The centrality of the meeting 

<br>Expectation as main place where God works
<br>Not Eph. 4
<br>Relatively few use gifts
<br>Lots of gifts and resources involved in preparing and doing.


<br>Equipping requires far more than hearing (hearing is the beginning)
<br>Have seen churches regularly appeal for help with the Sunday meeting, while great work people were doing on elsewhere was rarely mentioned. 
<br>Experiential 

<br>Decor, lighting, sound, music, energy 


<br>Centrality of the sermon 
<br><br>
<br>Individualistic
<br>Systematic theology

<br>Emphasis on correct belief but often not overtly connected with life
<br>Creeds
<br>Ordinances
<br>Salvation as legal status—actually can become impersonal


<br>Obstacles to life together 

<br>Urban life disconnects people from physical neighbors
<br>Net: Now people sit together and chat with other people on their phones.


<br><br>
<br>A place for everyone
<br>Everyone is a greeter
<br>Everyone is a teacher-in-training
<br><br><br>
<br>Pray, read, listen to God

<br>Comforts
<br>Children's education 


<br>6-day work week

<br>And many bottom-tier jobs work around labor laws, require 7 days
<br>Not the same as traditional 6-day rural life. This is usually work away from home, leaving minimal time for housework or errands.


<br>Result: people are busy and tired (all classes)

<br>Learning is a process of attaching new information to old

<br>Traveling takes too long
<br>Churches typically manage by making Sunday long, but that leaves out people working on Sundays.
<br>Frequent/flexible
<br>Sunday morning doesn't work at all for:

<br>Retail and hotel workers

<br>Many are teens/young adults--a key target population


<br>Women who work "at night"


<br>It can barely work for Monday-Saturday workers (factory and small business), who reserve Sundays for housework, errands and recreation
<br>Special need/interest groups (like any church)
<br>Couples' banquet
<br>Addictions support (rewrite Celebrate Recovery for Thai culture)
<br><br>
<br>Levels of ability/understanding
<br>Grade school

<br>Reads the words, does not understand many words, minimally understands meaning. 
<br>Will quickly forget


<br>Teaching must be concrete, rote<br>
- Memorized verses<br>
- Bible stories and parables<br>
- Repeated catch phrases

<br>Each step requires feedback


<br>Personally Interactive

<br>Follow Jesus' model--apply principle to context, not state principle and require people to apply to their own context. 
<br>Individual, whole life.<br>
"That’s fine but not what this means."
<br>Not only Q&amp;A inductive Bible study 

<br>Involves reading a passage and guiding people in understanding principles
<br>Only highly educated and/or exceptionally bright people can do it.
<br>E.g. SOAP method--answers to steps 2 and 3 will be all over the place, often completely unrelated to the intent of the passage.
<br>Inductive Bible reading must be the goal, but we have to help people get there.


<br>Walk with people

<br>What the story tells us about ourselves


<br>Repeated verbatim principles

<br>Designed for people to include non-christian friends and family
<br>As much as possible, each will teach a single principle with application

<br>Who is writing
<br>The writer's contemporary audience and situation
<br>The writer's purpose
<br>Key principle for us
<br>Specific actions we can take
